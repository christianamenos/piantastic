This little application will help you develop you piano skills. The notes will be shown into the screen, and you will have to select the correct key.

Use the virtual keyboard or a real piano (still to be developed) to follow the songs that will appear into the screen and keep improving your skills.

# Configuration

For the moment is just a plan HTML/JS/CSS app. Maybe I will put it as a desktop app with electron at some point.
